### 5. **Generating Reports & Dashboards**  
- BAs can create **custom reports and dashboards** to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and analyze project performance.  

### 6. **Test Case Management (if integrated with tools like Xray or Zephyr)**  
- BAs can help testers by linking requirements to test cases, ensuring complete coverage.  

### 7. **Change Management**
